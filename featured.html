<b>3. Angry Bird:</b></br>
</br>
'Angry Birds' for iPhone and iPad Free for First Time Ever</br>
</br>
The original Angry Birds for the iPhone debuted in the App Store in 2009 while the HD version for the iPad arrived in April 2010. The game proved to be tremendously popular, prompting Rovio to release additional versions including Angry Birds Seasons, Angry Birds Space, and Bad Piggies as well as t-shirts, hats, and just about anything else that you can slap the likeness of an Angry Bird on.</br>
</br>
Since its release, the original Angry Birds for iPhone has been priced at $.99 for most of its time in the App Store while the HD version has jumped around between $.99 and $4.99. Neither app has ever been available for free until now. Angry Birds and Angry Birds HD will remain free through Wednesday, March 13 and go back to their regular prices on Thursday, March 14. That gives you a nice window of time to download them but you should get to clicking the Buy Now buttons below sooner rather later lest you forget before this week's promotion ends.</br>

<b>1. Android App Pays You $25 a Month for Watching Ads:</b></br>
</br>
It's about time we got paid for watching ads. The Indiegogo project for SmartAds today announced its intentions to pay smartphone and tablet users up to $25 per device, per month to be served on the lock screen of their devices. If you have both a tablet and a phone, you could make as much as $50 each month.</br>
</br>
The company is starting with a free Android app that will be smart enough to target ads based on your interests and geographic location. If you find a particular ad offensive or unappealing you can "close" the to reveal your normal lock screen. If you love an ad, you can click for more info, buy the product/service, or share the deal with friends.</br>

            </br>
Google Finally Offers a Style Guide for Cleaning Up Your Crappy Android App</br>
</br>
Google's philosophy towards Android developers has been something along the lines of: If you build an app market, they will come. Leave the rigid quality control (and censorship) to companies named after fruit. But yesterday, three-and-a-half years in operation, Google finally launched an Android Design Guide. Considering that there are 700,000 new Android devices activated everyday, now's the time. Well, now or three years ago, either way.</br>
</br>
In an interview with Wired.com, Matias Duarte, Google head of user experience for Android, says the guide will give suggestions "on everything from how to implement different visual elements to overall back-end patterns for the OS itself."</br>

<b>3. Equala's App Plays Your Friends' Favorite Songs:</b></br>
</br>
Equala is a free social music app lets you to create a customized station of the music your friends listen to and share your favorite tracks. The app uses technology that accesses the music we share on Facebook from popular channels like Spotify and YouTube. The scanning process takes up to five minutes the first time you download the app, but the team uses the information to build a music profile for every user.</br>
</br>
For our friends that don't share their music on Facebook, the EQuala team is working on a new version of the app that may monitor our smartphone device to find out what music we're listening to.</br>

        <b>1. Why the New Microsoft Office Isn't a Windows 8 App:</b></br>
</br>
Microsoft launched the latest version of Office today, and the new apps are made for Windows 8. Strange, then, that the apps themselves aren't actually Windows 8 apps. The core of the new suite runs in a PC's desktop environment.</br>
</br>
However, Office, as it was designed to work in previous versions, has built-in sharing capabilities. Those features would have to be rebuilt to work with the new user interface. While the Office team could have done that, Hough says Microsoft didn't want to rush out a Windows 8 version of Office and risk serving up a poor user experience.</br>

<b>3.Run Windows 8's "modern" apps on the desktop:</b></br>
</br>
Stardock has just released ModernMix, a program that lets you run modern apps in resizable windows on the traditional desktop. ModernMix lets you multi-task apps in Windows. Say goodbye to full-screen-only modern apps.</br>
</br>
Stardock has a great reputation for releasing utilities that improve on basic Windows features. ModernMix isn't especially complicated; the app lets you choose whether modern apps will run full screen or in a window, and once on your desktop, modern apps work like any old program, complete with full multitasking, a minimize button, and a close button.
